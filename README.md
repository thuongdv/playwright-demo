# Playwright Demo Project

This project demonstrates end-to-end and UI automation testing using [Microsoft Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) for modern web applications. It includes advanced features such as shadow DOM handling, page object model, Allure and HTML reporting, and integration with Report Portal.

## 📋 Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18 or later recommended)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (comes with Node.js)
- Chrome browser (or other supported browsers)

## 🚀 How to Run Tests

1. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Configure environment variables:**

   - Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in your credentials (e.g. `TA_EMAIL`, `TA_PASSWORD`).

3. **Run all tests:**

   ```bash
   npx playwright test
   ```

   Or run a specific test file:

   ```bash
   npx playwright test tests/tc01.spec.ts
   ```

4. **Run with Allure or Report Portal:**
   - For Allure: Reports are generated automatically (see below).
   - For Report Portal: Set `REPORT=rp` in your environment before running tests.

## 📊 How to View Results

- **Playwright HTML Report:**

  ```bash
  npx playwright show-report
  ```

  Opens an interactive HTML report in your browser.

- **Allure Report:**

  ```bash
  npx allure serve allure-results
  ```

  Opens the Allure report locally.

- **Report Portal:**
  If configured, results are sent to your Report Portal instance.
